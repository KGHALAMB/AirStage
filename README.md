Airstage is an app meant to connect performers with venues.  As a performer, you can look at venue options based on location, size, cost/pay, and capacity.  As a venue, you can search and request for performers based on performance length, cost/pay, location, and type of performance. Venues and performers will be added to a database based on signups for the app.
